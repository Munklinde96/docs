# Getting started

Rig is an open-source application platform for Kubernetes that provides tools to build, deploy, and manage your applications. 
It is built on top of Kubernetes, with support for running on Docker intended for development purposes.

Rig supports deploying any containerized applications along with middleware to handle authentication and logging. 
You can deploy already-built applications, or use Rig's modules to easily build, and then deploy your backends.

In this document, you'll learn how to install Rig on **Docker** or **Kubernetes**, set up the CLI, and deploy your first Capsule.

## Install the Rig on Docker or Kubernetes
Rig can run in either Docker or Kubernetes. We suggest running Rig in Docker for local development
and in Kubernetes for production workloads. 

Install Rig using one of the two guides below:

<DocCardList items={[
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/getting-started/server-installation#installation-docker',
    label: 'Run in Docker',
    description: "Best for running locally on your computer",
    customProps: {
      icon: "docker",
      col: "col--6"
    }
  },
  {
    type: 'link',
    href: '/getting-started/server-installation#installation-kubernetes',
    label: 'Run in Kubernetes',
    description: "Best for running production workloads.",
    customProps: {
      icon: "kubernetes",
      col: "col--6"
    }
  }
]} />

## Install the Rig CLI
You can use the Rig CLI to interact with resources and modules on the platform. Follow the [CLI guide](/getting-started/cli-setup#install) to install it.

<hr class="solid" />

## Deploy your first application
Once Rig is installed, and the initial setup is complete, you are ready to deploy your first capsule. This can be an HTTP server, gRPC server, or something similar that you have built yourself or a Docker image that you want to deploy (like Nginx). Use the [application deployment guide](/capsules/create-deploy) to get started.
