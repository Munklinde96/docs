# Rig.dev Documentation

The Rig Platform offers an application platform for Kubernetes.
Rig empower developers to work in their own environments with elevated application abstractions,
while still leveraging Kubernetes's reliability, portability, and scalability.

The developer-friendly deployment engine simplifies the process of rolling out, managing, debugging and scaling applications.
The platform includes a Dashboard, CLI, and CI/CD hooks, as well as numerous ways of integrating with existing pipelines, such as GitOps.
